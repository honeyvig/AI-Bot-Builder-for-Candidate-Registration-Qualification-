# AI-Bot-Builder-for-Candidate-Registration-Qualification-
To develop a chatbot that can scrape FSBO (For Sale By Owner) listings and integrate it with your existing CRM, we can break down the solution into multiple components:

    Scraping FSBO Listings: We'll use Python to scrape FSBO listings from relevant websites.
    Chatbot: A chatbot can interact with users to gather property information and send it to the CRM.
    Chrome Extension: A Chrome extension can interact with users on the browser and initiate scraping or chatbot actions.

Let's dive into each part of the solution with Python code for scraping and building a basic Chrome extension for interaction.
1. Scraping FSBO Listings with Python

You can use libraries like BeautifulSoup for web scraping and requests to interact with the website.
Install Required Libraries:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Code for Scraping FSBO Listings:

This example demonstrates scraping FSBO listings from a hypothetical website.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_fsbo_listings(url):
    # Send a GET request to the website
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print("Failed to retrieve the page")
        return []

    # Parse the page content with BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # Find listings - Modify this based on the website's structure
    listings = soup.find_all('div', class_='listing')

    fsbo_properties = []
    for listing in listings:
        property = {
            'title': listing.find('h2').text,
            'price': listing.find('span', class_='price').text,
            'address': listing.find('div', class_='address').text,
            'details': listing.find('div', class_='details').text,
        }
        fsbo_properties.append(property)

    return fsbo_properties

# Example usage:
url = 'https://example.com/fsbo'
listings = get_fsbo_listings(url)
for listing in listings:
    print(listing)

2. Chatbot Integration with the Existing CRM

You can use Flask to create a simple web server and handle chatbot interactions. The chatbot can accept user input, such as property details, and send that data to the CRM (let's assume your CRM has an API for adding properties).
Install Required Libraries:

pip install flask requests

Code for Chatbot Server (Flask):

This chatbot will collect information about the FSBO listing and then send it to your CRM.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

CRM_API_URL = 'https://your-crm-api-url.com/add-property'

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    # Receive user input
    data = request.json
    title = data.get('title')
    price = data.get('price')
    address = data.get('address')
    details = data.get('details')

    # Process data (e.g., validation or further processing)
    property_data = {
        'title': title,
        'price': price,
        'address': address,
        'details': details
    }

    # Send data to CRM system
    crm_response = requests.post(CRM_API_URL, json=property_data)
    
    if crm_response.status_code == 200:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Property added successfully to CRM'}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Failed to add property to CRM'}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Example API Request to Chatbot:

You can call this chatbot API from your app, passing the property details as JSON:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "3 Bed House", "price": "$300,000", "address": "123 Main St", "details": "Nice family house"}'

3. Chrome Extension to Interact with Users

The Chrome Extension will interact with the user and trigger the chatbot's scraping functionality or handle data submission.
3.1 Chrome Extension Files

The Chrome Extension will consist of the following files:

    manifest.json: Configures the Chrome Extension
    popup.html: The interface for the user to interact with
    popup.js: JavaScript for handling interactions and making requests to the chatbot server

manifest.json (Metadata for the Extension):

{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "FSBO Scraper Chatbot",
  "description": "Scrape FSBO listings and interact with chatbot",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": ["activeTab"],
  "browser_action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  },
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"],
    "persistent": false
  },
  "icons": {
    "16": "icons/icon16.png",
    "48": "icons/icon48.png",
    "128": "icons/icon128.png"
  }
}

popup.html (User Interface for Extension):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>FSBO Scraper Chatbot</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>FSBO Property Scraper</h1>
    <button id="scrape-btn">Start Scraping</button>
    <p id="status"></p>
    <script src="popup.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

popup.js (Handle User Interaction):

document.getElementById('scrape-btn').addEventListener('click', function() {
  // Send a message to the content script or directly trigger scraping
  chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) {
    let activeTab = tabs[0];

    // Make an API call to start scraping and send data to the chatbot
    fetch('http://localhost:5000/chat', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        title: "Example Property",
        price: "$500,000",
        address: "456 Maple St",
        details: "Beautiful 4 bedroom house"
      })
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      document.getElementById('status').innerText = 'Scraping complete and data sent to CRM.';
    })
    .catch(error => {
      document.getElementById('status').innerText = 'Error: ' + error.message;
    });
  });
});

4. Final Integration

    FSBO Listings Scraping: Use Python for scraping FSBO listings, and the chatbot can process the data.
    CRM Integration: The chatbot processes user input and sends it to your CRM API for adding properties.
    Chrome Extension: The Chrome Extension provides an interface for users to trigger scraping and initiate interactions with the chatbot.

This solution provides a basic setup for scraping FSBO listings, sending the data to your CRM, and interacting via a Chrome Extension. You can enhance this by adding advanced functionality like user authentication, persistent data storage, etc.

python cod eof r  build us a agent  with relevance ai the bot will take an api input then call what’s app or sms a candidate to qualify if they are worth registering 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

To build an AI agent that qualifies a candidate via an API input and uses WhatsApp or SMS to communicate with the candidate, we can break this down into several steps:

    Receive API input: The agent will receive data about the candidate (e.g., name, phone number, qualification criteria, etc.).
    Trigger WhatsApp or SMS: Based on the received input, the agent will send a message to the candidate via WhatsApp or SMS.
    Candidate Response: The agent will then wait for a response from the candidate to qualify or disqualify them.
    Qualification Check: Based on the candidate's response, the agent will determine whether the candidate is worth registering.

Tools and Services:

    Twilio: To send SMS or WhatsApp messages.
    Relevance AI: To make decisions about the candidate's response based on predefined criteria.
    Flask or FastAPI: For creating the backend that receives API input.
    Webhook: To handle incoming candidate responses.

Step-by-Step Solution
1. Setup Twilio for SMS/WhatsApp

First, you need to sign up for a Twilio account and obtain your API credentials (Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio Phone Number).
2. Install Twilio SDK

Install Twilio SDK in your Python environment.

pip install twilio

3. Setup Flask for Backend

We will create a Flask application that handles API requests and sends SMS/WhatsApp messages to candidates.

pip install Flask

4. Code Example

Here’s the Python code to create the agent that sends SMS or WhatsApp messages using Twilio and waits for candidate responses to qualify them:
app.py (Flask Application)

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from twilio.rest import Client
from twilio.twiml.messaging_response import MessagingResponse

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Twilio credentials (replace with your own)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_account_sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_auth_token'
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your_twilio_number'  # Use the number you registered on Twilio

client = Client(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)

# Dummy qualification criteria function
def qualify_candidate(response):
    if 'yes' in response.lower():
        return True
    return False

# Endpoint to initiate the qualification process
@app.route('/start_qualification', methods=['POST'])
def start_qualification():
    # Get candidate details from the API request
    data = request.json
    candidate_phone = data.get('phone')
    candidate_name = data.get('name')
    qualification_criteria = data.get('qualification_criteria')

    # Construct the message based on qualification criteria
    message = f"Hello {candidate_name}, are you interested in registering for the opportunity? Respond with 'YES' or 'NO'."

    # Send the message to the candidate via SMS or WhatsApp
    message_sent = client.messages.create(
        body=message,
        from_=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
        to=candidate_phone
    )

    return jsonify({"status": "Message sent", "message_sid": message_sent.sid}), 200

# Endpoint to handle candidate responses
@app.route('/receive_response', methods=['POST'])
def receive_response():
    # Parse incoming SMS response (from Twilio)
    incoming_msg = request.form.get('Body')
    candidate_phone = request.form.get('From')

    # Check if the candidate qualifies based on their response
    if qualify_candidate(incoming_msg):
        response_message = "You qualify for registration! We'll contact you soon."
    else:
        response_message = "Unfortunately, you don't meet the criteria for registration."

    # Send qualification result back to candidate
    response = MessagingResponse()
    response.message(response_message)

    return str(response)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of the Code:

    /start_qualification Endpoint:
        This endpoint receives a POST request with candidate details (phone number, name, qualification criteria).
        It sends a message via Twilio to the candidate's phone number (either via SMS or WhatsApp).
        The message asks the candidate if they are interested in registering (they reply with "YES" or "NO").

    /receive_response Endpoint:
        This endpoint listens for incoming messages from candidates. When a candidate responds, Twilio triggers this webhook with the candidate's message.
        It then processes the candidate’s response (e.g., checks if they replied with “YES” to qualify them).
        The bot sends a reply message to the candidate, either confirming or denying their qualification.

    Twilio API:
        The client.messages.create() method sends the initial message to the candidate.
        The MessagingResponse() object is used to send a response back to the candidate after they reply.

5. Running the App

To run the application, you will need to start the Flask server:

python app.py

This will start a server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default.
6. Testing the System

    Start Qualification: Make a POST request to /start_qualification to send the initial SMS or WhatsApp message to a candidate.

    Example JSON payload for starting qualification:

    {
        "phone": "+1234567890",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "qualification_criteria": "Interested in a job offer"
    }

    Receive Candidate Response: When the candidate responds via SMS or WhatsApp, Twilio will send the response to your /receive_response endpoint.

    You should be able to check if the response qualifies the candidate and send back the appropriate message.

7. Webhook URL for Twilio

To handle incoming responses from Twilio (candidates' replies), you need to configure the webhook URL in your Twilio account.

    Go to Twilio Console.
    Navigate to the phone number settings.
    Under "Messaging" settings, set the "A MESSAGE COMES IN" URL to the /receive_response endpoint of your Flask app (e.g., http://your_server_url/receive_response).

8. Future Improvements

    Integrating with CRM: After qualifying the candidate, you can integrate this agent with your CRM by making an API call to add the qualified candidate to the system.
    Enhanced Qualifying Logic: Improve the qualifying logic based on more complex criteria.
    Voice Support: Use Twilio’s Voice API to handle voice-based communication with candidates.

This solution provides a basic framework for building an AI-driven agent that can send SMS or WhatsApp messages, interact with candidates, and qualify them based on their responses. You can expand on this with more complex logic, deeper integrations, and advanced AI features.
